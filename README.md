I'm a Computer Engineer student who is passionate for learning new development technologies.Some technologies i enjoy working with include React and React Native.

"You only fail when you stop trying" That's a good phrase to introduce myself, i'm probably not the smartest one, but i'm a little bit stubborn kkk. I believe what makes you great it's not your inteligence(of course it is important), but your tenacity.
